## Where to Get WhatsApp Icons

You can:
1. Extract the icon from WhatsApp Web (https://web.whatsapp.com/favicon.ico)
2. Download from icon repositories (ensure licensing allows usage)
3. Create your own based on WhatsApp branding guidelines

## Quick Setup

For now, you can use any placeholder PNG images with the correct dimensions.
The app will work with any PNG files in these sizes.

To download WhatsApp's official icon:
```bash
# Download favicon and convert to larger sizes
wget https://static.whatsapp.net/rsrc.php/v3/yP/r/rYZqPCBaG70.png -O icon.png
```

Or use a simple green circle as a placeholder for testing.
